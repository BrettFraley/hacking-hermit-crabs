Brainstorm
---------------

Little boxes that are 'nodes'
 -- These little boxes are a hermit crab on/with a 'computer'

Players goal is to grow the crabs and migrate them to larger shells

"When a hermit crab moves into a new shell, it's called molting.
This process is similar to how reptiles shed their skin,
as hermit crabs outgrow their exoskeletons and need to shed them.
Most hermit crabs molt every 12â€“18 months."


-- Randomly assign names to crabs
-- Randomly place nodes
-- Depending on screen size, how to break up 'screen blocks'
   into 50px wide sections to fill
-- Maybe do 15 'nodes'
-- Randomly walk crab chars around
-- Goal is to grow crabs by 10x
-- Need to be fed and water
-- Maybe the hacking component is to run machinery to 
   deliver sustenance to them
-- Whats the 'game world' time like via months
-- Every 5 mins a crab may grow.. so one at it's full size takes
   50 minutes in game..?

   GAMEPLAY:

    Type commands into the screen areas
    Keep commands limited
    Maybe there's some puzzle or bug to solve
    Maybe their nodes need connected for water or food transport
    Collect shells
    Grow the crabs
    How do crabs die? hmm?
    -- UI NOTE: 
        -- instead of having to zoom the whole
            browser window.. click on a node,
            it scales up and center.


UPDATE: CURRENT TODO:

- Get 'Crab Node' UI / Enlarge/Resize of nodes / Computer Nodes UI
- Break out some code into seperate files, eg: the computer logic and state

Do stats (food inventory, water supply, shells)

Do animation of crabs..etc..

Add water and food meters
Figure out what goes on the crabs' computer menus and help
Figure out what commands are and what they do (eg: deliver food, shells, water)...
GOAL: grow all 15 crabs to 10x over 50 mins (mvp level)
    - To do so: crabs must coordinate their machines (connect them)



UPDATE: IDEA
---------------------

The 'crab nodes' aren't the computers... they're visually a little aquarium with the computers
in them.. and the first machines they use are little cranes that go out on a x, y, z plane
to gather and deliver resources... hence the commands for the computers control the movement
and actions of the machines.. eg: gather food from x, y, z | deliver water to 'crab name'..etc

UPDATE: MINIMAL CONCEPT TO REACH...
-------------------------------
    // So maybe in time crab auto consumes water and food,
    // and player job/goal is to supply the crabs through machine commands
    // Time will tick and health reduces...and crabs will consume as they need..
    // and over time they will molt..only if larger shells are available
    // if can't molt, or water is zero or food is zero... game over
    // If all 16 crabs molt to 10...WINNER

UPDATE: CRAB PROPERTIES:
   - Crabs need a size property (goal is to reach 10)
      -- larger crabs need to consume more food and water more often

   - There can be 1 'gathering/machine/crane or other tool' that all use
      -- and only one process can be carried out by any one 'crab node'
         at a time..hence the concept of queing jobs..
      -- and or additional 'machinery' can be acquired

   - // TODO: molt times will be dynamic per crab's size

   - Top menu bars of node computers should have a blue or reduces
     status indicating either a health issue or supply issue

     TASKS NOW:
     1. IF food low, IF water low, or zero shells --- red menu bar
     2. Create first input / output command / interaction on node 1
