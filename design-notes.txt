Brainstorm
---------------

Little boxes that are 'nodes'
 -- These little boxes are a hermit crab on/with a 'computer'

Players goal is to grow the crabs and migrate them to larger shells

"When a hermit crab moves into a new shell, it's called molting.
This process is similar to how reptiles shed their skin,
as hermit crabs outgrow their exoskeletons and need to shed them.
Most hermit crabs molt every 12â€“18 months."


-- Randomly assign names to crabs
-- Randomly place nodes
-- Depending on screen size, how to break up 'screen blocks'
   into 50px wide sections to fill
-- Maybe do 15 'nodes'
-- Randomly walk crab chars around
-- Goal is to grow crabs by 10x
-- Need to be fed and water
-- Maybe the hacking component is to run machinery to 
   deliver sustenance to them
-- Whats the 'game world' time like via months
-- Every 5 mins a crab may grow.. so one at it's full size takes
   50 minutes in game..?

   GAMEPLAY:

    Type commands into the screen areas
    Keep commands limited
    Maybe there's some puzzle or bug to solve
    Maybe their nodes need connected for water or food transport
    Collect shells
    Grow the crabs
    How do crabs die? hmm?
    -- UI NOTE: 
        -- instead of having to zoom the whole
            browser window.. click on a node,
            it scales up and center.


UPDATE: CURRENT TODO:

Do stats
Do animation of crabs..etc..
Align 'nodes' in columns
Add water and food meters
Figure out what goes on the crabs' computer menus and help
Figure out what commands are and what they do (eg: deliver food, shells, water)...
GOAL: grow all 15 crabs to 10x over 50 mins (mvp level)
    - To do so: crabs must coordinate their machines (connect them)
