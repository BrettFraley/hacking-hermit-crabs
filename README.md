Hacking Hermit Crabs is a quirky and inventive game where players control a group of clever hermit crabs who must program virtual machines to survive.

Using in-game computers, these crabs hack and code commands to operate complex machinery, gather essential resources like food and water, and find bigger shells as they grow. The more they evolve, the more intricate the challenges become, requiring creative coding to unlock new tools and keep up with their ever-expanding needs. 
 
It's a fun fusion of programming, problem-solving, and survival strategy!
